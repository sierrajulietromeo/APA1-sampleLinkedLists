# Linked List Examples

This repository contains two JavaScript implementations of a basic linked list:

## Procedural Linked List

- `functionalVersion.js`: This file demonstrates a linked list implementation using a procedural programming style. It includes functions for creating a linked list from an array of numbers and displaying the list's contents.

## Object-Oriented Linked List

- `oopVersion.js`: This file provides an object-oriented implementation of a linked list. It defines a `Node` class to represent individual nodes and a `LinkedList` class to encapsulate the list and its operations.

## Usage

Both implementations provide a basic example of creating a linked list from an array of numbers and displaying its contents. You can run each file directly in a Node.js environment to see the output.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning resource to understand the differences between procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms in the context of a simple data structure like a linked list.
